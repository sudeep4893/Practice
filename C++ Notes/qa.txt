Q) what is the difference between
a struct and a class?

A)In C a struct is a group of variables only.
It defines a new secondary datatype.

In C++ a class is a group of variables 
and functions.
It defines a new secondary datatype.
Defining a class is implementing encapsulation.

Q) what is the difference between
a struct of C++ and a class of C++?

A) In C++ a struct and a class are
all similar (both are group of variables
and functions) and can be used interchangably.

Only one difference between the two
is that members of a struct are "public"
by default and members of a class are
"private" by default.
