About use of access specifiers while inheritance

Known that while inheriting a class we apply
some access specifier.

class Derived : <access specifier> Base
{}

Possible access specifiers are
1) private (default)
2) protected
3) public

Due to private access specifier while inheritance
protected and public members of base class become 
private members of the derived class. 

Due to protected access specifier while inheritance
protected and public members of base class become 
protected members of the derived class. 

Due to public access specifier while inheritance
protected and public members of base class 
remain protected and public members respectively
in the derived class. 

private members of base class are not accessible 
to the derived class.
