Common Member Functions for Vector

reference back( );
	Returns a reference to the last element in the vector.

iterator begin( );
	Returns an iterator to the first element in the vector.

void clear( ); 
	Removes all elements from the vector.

bool empty( ); 
	Returns true if the invoking vector is empty and false otherwise.

iterator end( );
	Returns an iterator to the end of the vector.

iterator erase(iterator i); 
	Removes the element pointed to by i.
	Returns an iterator to the element after the one removed.

reference front( );
	Returns a reference to the first element in the vector.

iterator insert(iterator i, val);
	Inserts val immediately before the element specified by i. 
	An iterator to the element is returned.

void pop_back( ); 
	Removes the last element in the vector.

void push_back(val); 
	Adds an element with the value specified by val to the end of the vector.
size( ) 
	Returns the number of elements currently in the vector.

The following comparison operators are defined for vector:
==, <, <=, !=, >, >=
The subscripting operator [ ] is also defined for
vector. This allows array like access of the elements 
of a  vector
