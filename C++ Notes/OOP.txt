Object Oriented programming (OOP) 
is a programming pattern that represents 
concepts as "objects" that have data 
fields (properties that describe the object) 
and associated methods (functions that 
represent the operations of object).  

OOP design implements

Encapsulation
A language construct that facilitates the 
binding of code and data in one unit.
 
Polymorphism 
Is the ability to define an operation that 
has more than one forms i.e. can be
implemented in multiple ways to yield the
same result. 

Inheritance
is a way to build extended objects
from existing objects.

Data Abstraction 
is the process by which data and programs
are defined with a representation similar 
in form to its meaning, while hiding away 
the implementation  details.
