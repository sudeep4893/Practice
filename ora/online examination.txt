Rough Draft
-----------
Student (sid, sname, saddress, sphone)
Semester (semId, semName)
Branch (brId, brName)
 
Question Bank 
  Subject (subId, subName)
  Chapter (chId, chName, chWtg)
  Questions (qid, question, op1, op2, op3, op4, ans)

Normalized tables
----------------
Student (sid, sname, saddress, sphone)
Semester (semId, semName)
Branch (brId, brName)

We need to relate the above tables so
that collective information can be obtained

1 branch has many semesters
1 semester has many branches
so two table have many to many relationship
plus
1 student has 1 branch
1 branch has many students

student table add branch id
plus
1 student has 1 sem
1 sem has many students

student table add sem id

Student (sid, sname, saddress, sphone, brId , semId)
           1     aaa      pune    123       1   , 1
           2     bbb      pune    231       1   , 1
           3     ccc      pune    234       1   , 1
           4     aaa      pune    123       1   , 2
           5     bbb      pune    231       1   , 2
           6     ccc      pune    234       1   , 2

here we see redundancy of sname, saddress, sphone
so separate them

Student (sid, sname, saddress, sphone)
           1     aaa      pune    123   
           2     bbb      pune    231   
           3     ccc      pune    234    

Admission
aid  sid brId semId   yr 
1      1     1      1   2013
2      2     1      1  
3      3     1      1
4      1     1      2   2014

Subject (subId, subName)

Chapter (chId, chName, chWtg)

1 Subject has many chapters
1 chapter has 1 subject

so the two table have 1 to many relationship
wrt subject to chapters

so subjectid must be introduced as FK into
chapter

Subject (subId, subName)
           1       oracle
           2       VB 

Chapter (chId, chName, chWtg, sid)
            1     joins      10       1
            2     nQry      9        1
            3     ADODB   10       2 

Questions (qid, question, op1, op2, op3, op4, ans)

Relate Chapter and Questions
1 chapter has many questions
1 question hasl 1 chapter
so they have 1 to many relationship 
wrt 1 chapter many questions

so add chId as FK in qid

Questions (qid, question, op1, op2, op3, op4, ans, chid)
