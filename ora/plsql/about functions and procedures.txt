A stored procedure or a function is a named 
PL/SQL  block of code.

It is a logically grouped set of SQL/PLSQL 
statements that perform a specific task.

Syntax to create a procedure

create or replace procedure <procedureName>( argument [IN|OUT|IN OUT] datatype, ...)
<IS|AS>

declarations

BEGIN
   plsql code

EXCEPTION
   exception handling code
END;
/


Syntax to create a function

create or replace function <functionName>( argument [IN|OUT|IN OUT] datatype, ...)
return datatype

<IS|AS>

declarations

BEGIN
   plsql code
EXCEPTION
   exception handling code
END;
/

Observe the use of IN or OUT or IN OUT
qualifiers along with the arguments.

The IN qualifier is used for the arguments 
that must be read only for the called function/procedure.
The values of IN arguments must be specified 
while calling the function/procedure.

The OUT qualifier is used for the arguments 
that must be writable for the called function/procedure.
Through argument using an OUT qualifier the 
called function/procedure passes a value back 
to the caller.

The INOUT qualifier signifies that the 
argument is characteristic of IN and OUT both.

IF no qualifier is specified then the default 
qualifier is IN.
