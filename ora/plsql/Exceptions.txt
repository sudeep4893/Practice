Exception
---------
An exception is a runtime error that causes
abnormal program termination.

An exception may be generated
1) By DBMS Engine
2) By code (to deal with logically wrong cases)

If an exception is not handled then program
(PLSQL BLOCK) terminates.
To protect the program from abnormal termination
one must use EXCEPTION HANDLING in PLSQL block.

For EXCEPTION HANDLING in PLSQL block one
must define the EXCEPTION sub-section of BEGIN

DECLARE
  variable/other declarations
BEGIN
  PLSQ code
  SQL statements
  ...
EXCEPTION
  Exception Handling Code
END;
/

If there is no exception then code of 
EXCEPTION sub-section will not exceute.

If there is some exception then 
a) normal execution of statements of PLSQL block gets interrupted.
b) program control is transfered into EXCEPTION sub-section of PLSQL block.
c) exception handling code corresponding to the current exception executes.
d) if no case to handle the current exception then program terminates abnormally.

About Exceptions Generated by DBMS ENGINE
----------------------------------------
* are generated by system
* cause program termination
* program termination can be avoided by exception handling code.

About Exceptions Generated by Code
--------------------------------
* are generated by code when logically wrong cases are encountered
* cause program termination
* program termination can be avoided by exception handling code.
