Packages

A package is a collection of logically related 
PLSQL blocks, procedures, functions and variables. 

A package consists of  
1) package specification 
2) package body. 

The package specification defines the interface 
(signatures) that are usable for application programmers.

The package body implements the package specification .

Syntax

Create or replace package <packName> as
  function declaration
  procedure declaration
  ...
end <packName>;
/

create or replace package body <packName> as

  function definition

  procedure definition

  ....
end <packName>;    
/

Using a package 
packName.fnname;

Imp:
If any object(function, cursor, etc) is defined
in package body only and not declared in the
package specification then that object is termed
as local / private to the package and cannot
be used outside the package.
