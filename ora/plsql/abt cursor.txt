A Cursor is a work area in memory
which a DBMS (Oracle) uses for 
execution of SQL  statements.

For a query (select), the area in 
memory also includes column headings 
and rows retrieved by the query.

Cursor can be of 2 types
1) Implicit
2) Explicit

Implicit cursors are managed (Opened/
Fetched/Closed) by the system.
It has a default name "SQL".

Any SQL statement written in a 
PLSQL  block forms an "implicit cursor".


Explicit cursors are managed  (Opened/
Fetched/Closed) by plsql code.

An explicit cursor is defined using a 
select sql statement.

Being explict the cursor is 
Opened/ Fetched/Closed by code
and its data processed as per 
application logic.

                 Cursor Attributes

There are 4 cursor attributes
that can be used to check the
state of the cursor (implicit/explicit)

1) %ISOPEN
     Returns true if cursor is open, otherwise false
2) %FOUND
     Returns true if record is fetched  successfully, otherwise false
3) %NOTFOUND
     Returns true if record is not fetched  successfully, otherwise false
4) %ROWCOUNT
     Returns the number of records fetched from the cursor 	

---------------------------------------------------------------------
parameterized cursor 

A parameterized cursor is the one that
accepts parameters and uses them in its
SQL.

Parameters are passed while opening the cursor.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
cursor for loop

A cursor for loop is a special loop designed to
parse cursors.
It automatically opens, fetchs and closes the
cursor.
The loop variable is automatically defined with
%ROWTYPE.

A variable with %ROWTYPE can be used to
hold entire row.
