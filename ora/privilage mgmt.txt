Privilage Management

Privilages define the rights that allow a user 
to use some/all Oracle resources.

Objects that are created by a user are owned 
and controlled by that user. 
If a user wishes to access any of the other 
users objects then the owner of the object 
will have to give permissions for such an access.
This is called as Granting Privilages.

Privilages once granted can be taken  back by 
the owner of the object. 
This is called as Revoking Privilages.

Oracle provides grant and revoke statements 
for privilage management.

Syntax

on <tablename>

grant object privilages to other users.
