To modify a records (rows/tuples) of a table
use the "update" statement

syntax
-------
update <tableName>
set
col1 = val1, col2 = val2, ... , colN = valN
[clause];

example 1 : to increment the salary of all employees by 1
sql> update employee
set
esal = esal +1;

Note that by default update statement affects
all records of the table.
To limit the records being modified by update
statement, one must apply where clause to it.

example 2 : to set the names of all peons to uppercase
sql> update employee
set
ename = upper(ename)
where ejob = 'peon';

----------------------------------------------------

To delete records (rows/tuples) of a table
use the "delete" statement

syntax
-------
delete from <tableName>
[clause];

example : to delete all records
--------
sql> delete from employee;

example : to delete all managers
--------
sql> delete from employee
where ejob = 'manager';


NOTE : Entire row gets deleted, cannot delete
limited columns. TO delete limited columns use
update statement.

NOTE : By default delete deletes all the records
of the table.
Hence used of where clause is recommended.
