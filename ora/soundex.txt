The SOUNDEX() function converts a string 
into a special four-character code representing 
the way the string sounds rather than how it 
is spelled. 

syntax:
-------
SOUNDEX(name_to_be_converted_to_code);

The first character in the code is always the 
first character of the original string.
Following that is a three digit number 
representing how the word sounds based 
on the SOUNDEX() guidelines. 

Examples

sql> select soundex('computer') , soundex('computor') from dual;

sql> select * from emp where 
     soundex(ejob) = soundex('clark');

sql> select * from emp where 
     soundex(ejob) = soundex('pion');


Note 
------
MS Access doesn’t support the SOUNDEX() function.
