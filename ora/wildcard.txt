Wildcard characters
-------------------

Oracle supports use of wildcard character
for pattern formation.
Next the patterns can be compared with column
values.

This allows generic filteration/selection of
records.

For pattern matching one must apply "like"
or "not like" operators in the where clause
of select statement.

"=", "<>", "in", "not in" operators are for
precise match and must be avoided in case
of pattern match.

The two supported wildcard characters are
1) _ : matches with any one character
2) % : matches with zero to many characters

Examples
---------
show employees with name starting with letter 'a'
sql> select * from emp where ename like 'a%';

show employees with name ending with letter 'c'
sql> select * from emp where ename like '%c';

show employees having letter 'c' in their name
sql> select * from emp where ename like '%c%';

show employees having 4 letter name
sql> select * from emp where ename like '____'; (4 underscores)

show employees having 4 or more letters in name
sql> select * from emp where ename like '____%'; (4 underscores and a %)

show employees having less than 4 letters in name
sql> select * from emp where ename not like '____%'; (4 underscores and a %)

(NOTE THAT PATTERN MATCHING CAN
BE APPLIED IN NUMERIC FIELDS ALSO)

show employees having '1' in eno
sql> select * from emp where eno like '%1%';
