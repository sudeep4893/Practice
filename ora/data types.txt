Oracle offers the following basic data types:
 
char(n): Fixed-length character data (string), n characters long. 
The maximum size for n is 2000. 
Note that a string of type char is always padded on
right with blanks to full length of n. 

varchar2(n): Variable-length character string. The maximum size for n is 4000. 
Only the bytes used for a string require storage.

number(o,d) : Numeric data type for integers and reals. 
o = overall number of digits
d = number of digits to the right of the decimal point.

Examples: number(8), number(5,2)
Note that, e.g., number(5,2) can 
contain anything upto 999.99 
without resulting in an error. 

Data types derived from number are int[eger], dec[imal], smallint and real.

date: Date data type for storing date and time.
The default format for a date is: DD-MMM-YY. Examples: '13-OCT-11', '07-JAN-13'

long: Character data up to a length of 2GB. 
Only one long column is allowed per table.

Note: In Oracle-SQL there is no data type 
boolean. It can, however, be simulated 
by using either char(1) or number(1).
