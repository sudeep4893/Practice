Transactions

A set of logically related dml statements 
performing a series of operations on Oracle 
tables forms a Transaction.

The requested operations are done as demanded
but oracle makes the  changes permanent only when
commit statement is issued.

On the otherside if a Rollback  statement is 
issued then Oracle undo's all the dml operations
until last commit.

A transaction begins with the  first dml statement
after a commit or connection made to oracle engine.

A transaction can be completed by issuing  commit.
And can be undone by issuing  rollback.


Savepoint
A savepoint is a mark for current point  within 
a transaction.

To create a savepoint
   Savepoint <name>;

Rollback can be fired with or without a savepoint.

sql> rollback;
A rollback without any savepoint undo's the 
entire transaction.

sql> rollback to savepoint <savepointname>;

A rollback with a savepoint, undo's the transaction
upto the savepoint mark.

As a rollback (without savepoint) or a commit is 
fired all the established savepoints are cleared.

A proper combination of commit, rollback and 
savepoints allow controlling the state of a tables.
