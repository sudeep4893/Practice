Self Joins
A self join allows connecting a table with itself.
A self join may be a cross / an inner / an outer join.

Generally a self join is used in case we want to 
perform a match on rows of same table.

eg fetch employees having same name.

we need to load the same table in memory 
twice , so that we can  compare their rows.

  X (alias)		  Y (alias)
1 aaa   ...		1 aaa   ...
2 bbb   ...		2 bbb   ...
3 ccc   ...		3 ccc   ...   
4 ddd   ...		4 ddd   ...
5 eee   ...		5 eee   ...
6 aaa   ...		6 aaa   ...
7 ggg   ...		7 ggg   ...

 To view emps with same name

select distinct X.eno, X.ename, X.ejob
from 
emp X inner join emp Y
on emp.ename = emp.ename
and
X.eno <> Y.eno;


To fetch depts of same city

select distinct X.dname, X.dloc
from 
dept X inner join dept Y
on X.dloc = Y.dloc
and
X.dno <> Y.dno;
