group by
---------
group by clause of select statement is used 
to form identical sub sets of data fetched 
by the select statement.

If output of a select statement fetching 
multiple columns is to be grouped then
actually the grouping is to be performed 
on records and not on fields.

Hence it is complusory to use the same set 
of columns in the group by caluse as used in
the select statement.

Note that use of * in select statement that
applies group by caluse is invalid.

Use of aggregate functions in select statements
that apply group by clause, returns more meaningfull
results.

examples
----------
1) to fetch records jobwise 
sql> select ejob from emp
     group by ejob;

2) to fetch jobwise records and their count
sql> select ejob , count(*) from emp
     group by ejob;

3) to fetch records and count of records
   jobwise deptnamewise.

sql> select ejob, dname, count(*)
     from
     emp inner join dept
     on emp.dno = dept.dno
     group by ejob, dname;

4) show max and min salary jobwise
sql> select ejob, max(esal), min(esal)
     from emp 
     group by ejob;

5) show average salary departmentwise

sql> select dname, avg(esal)
     from 
     dept inner join emp
     on 
     dept.dno = emp.dno
     group by dname;


having statement
----------------
As results of records fetched by a select 
statement are filtered using "where" 
similarly results of subsets formed by 
"group by" are filtered using "having statement".

examples
--------
6) show max and min salary for clerks and peons
sql> select ejob, max(esal), min(esal)
     from emp 
     group by ejob
     having ejob in('peon', 'clerk');
 

7) to fetch details of employees who are 
   max jobwise.
   
select * from emp
where ejob =
(
  select ejob from emp
  group by ejob
  having count(*) =
  (
    select max(count(*)) from emp
    group by ejob
  )
);
