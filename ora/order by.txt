Order by clause
--------------
Order by clause is used to order (sort) the
records fetched using a select statement.
(Doesnt sort table data).

Ordering is columnwise and can be applied
to multiple columns as well.

Ordering is by default in ascending form.
It can be changed to descending form by
use of DESC keyword along with order by
clause.
For explicit specification of ascending sort
the keyword in ASC.

If use then Order by caluse must be the
last clause of a select statement.

examples
---------
TO FETCH ALL EMPLOYEES IN ORDER OF THEIR SALARIES
sql> select * from emp order by esal;

TO FETCH MANAGERS IN ORDER OF THEIR DESCENDING SALARIES
sql> select * from emp 
     where ejob = 'manager'
     order by esal DESC;

TO FETCH ALL EMPLOYEES IN ASCENDING ORDER OF JOB AND DESCENDING ORDER OF SALARIES
sql> select * from emp
     order by ejob ASC , esal DESC; 
or
sql> select * from emp
     order by ejob , esal DESC; 

TO FETCH ALL EMPLOYEES NAMEWISE
sql> select * from emp order by ename;


NOTE : Order by clause will arrange
names with CAPITAL case letters first and
then names with SMALL case letters 
and finally names with NULL in ascending sort.
