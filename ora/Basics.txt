Everyone has data to store.
It is important to store the data in such a way
that it becomes easy and efficient to
fetch it back and to manipulate it.

A database is a collection of information.

DBMS (Database management system) is a 
software tool that is used for efficient
management of data.

A DBMS may store data in tables (relation)
and hence may be called as RDBMS.

A table (relation) is defined as a collection of
homogenous records (rows/tuples).

A record (row/tuple) is a collection of hetrogenous
fields (columns/attributes).
---------------------------------------------

As we analyze a real life system we end up in a 
collection of entities.
Every entity has its set of attributes.
Finally the real life system is represented as a 
complex dataset containing many entities and
their attributes.

Such datasets have anomalies and must be normalized.

Normalization is the process of dividing a complex
dataset into multiple smaller managable datasets.

Normalization is generally done upto 3 levels.
These 3 levels are 3 normal forms.

First Normal Form (FNF)
----------------------
a) Every table must have a primary key.
( Primary key is a column value of which 
is unique and is not missing for any row.)

b) Table must not have multivalued columns.
Example
--------

Person
------
pid    pname    page     phobbies
1       aaa       20      carft, drawing, ...
2       bbb       21      driving, drawing 
3       ccc       22       ... 

The column phobbies of table person is multivalued.
It must be eleminated.

Solution
--------
Person
------
pid    pname    page     
1       aaa       20      
2       bbb       21      
3       ccc       22      

Hobby
------
hid    hname
1      craft  
2      drawing
3      cooking

The tables that are separated must be linked so
that collective information is accessible.
It can be understood that 
1 person can have Many hobbies
AND
1 hobby can be of Many people.
We conclude that the two tables have
MANY to MANY relationship.

PersonHobby
------------
phid   pid  hid
1       1    1 
2       1    2
3       1    3 
4       2    2
5       2    3

c) Table must not have repeating groups.
Repeating groups are columns that store same type
of information for a record.

Example
--------
Student
--------
sid    sname    course1   course2
1       aaa         C         Ora
2       bbb         C++
3       ccc         Java

The columns course1 and course2 of table student
are repeating groups.
They must be eleminated.

Solution
--------
Student
--------
sid    sname    
1       aaa     
2       bbb     
3       ccc     

Course
-------
cid   cname
1      C
2      C++
3      Oracle
4      Java

The tables that are separated must be linked so
that collective information is accessible.
It can be understood that 
1 student can have Many courses
AND
1 course can be done by Many students.
We conclude that the two tables have
MANY to MANY relationship.

StudentCourse
--------------
scid   sid  cid
1       1    1 
2       1    2
3       1    3 
4       2    2
5       2    3
===================================

Second Normal Form (SNF)
----------------------
a) table must be in FNF
b) Every column of the table must have functional dependency on PK.
i.e. The columns of the table that are not functionally dependent on the PK must be eleminated. 

Non functionally dependent cols create redundancy.

employee
----------
eid   ename   eaddress  department 
1      aaa       qwe      sales        
2      bbb       asd      sales        
3      ccc       zxc      purchase
4      ddd       dfg      sales

In the above table (employee) the  column 
(department) doesnot have functional 
dependency on PK (eid)
It must be eleminated.

employee
----------
eid   ename   eaddress   did
1      aaa       qwe        1
2      bbb       asd        1
3      ccc       zxc        2
4      ddd       dfg        1

department
----------
did   dname          
1      sales           
2      purchase
3      production

The tables that are separated must be linked so
that collective information is accessible.
It can be understood that 
1 employee can be in 1 department
AND
1 department can have Many employees.

We conclude that the two tables have
1 to MANY relationship.
So set the PK of department table as
FK of employee table

===================================
Third Normal Form (TNF)
----------------------
a) table must be in SNF
b) The columns of the table that are transitively dependent on the PK must be eleminated. 


employee
----------
eid   ename   eaddress  esal   etax
1      aaa       qwe      100     10
2      bbb       asd      200     25
3      ccc       zxc      300     40 

In the above table (employee) the  column 
(etax) has functional dependency on column (esal)
and not the PK (eid)
i.e. the column (etax) has transitive dependency on
PK (eid)
It must be eleminated.

employee
----------
eid   ename   eaddress   pid
1      aaa       qwe        1
2      bbb       asd        2 
3      ccc       zxc         3 

package
----------
pid   sal   tax
1     100    10
2     200    25 
3     300    40

The tables that are separated must be linked so
that collective information is accessible.
It can be understood that 
1 employee can have 1 package
AND
1 package can be of Many employees.

We conclude that the two tables have
1 to MANY relationship.

So set the PK of package table as
FK of employee table
