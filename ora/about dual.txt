To practice built in functions
we either need a block of code (PLSQL)
or may use select statement.

Recall that select statement supports use
of functions in place of col list.

But select also requires a table to act on.
And select returns the answer n times, where
n = number of rows in table.

So to see an answer (of any function) only
once, select must act on a table that has
only one row.

Either make such a table or use the readymade
table named 'dual'.

'dual' has one col named "Dummy" of type
varchar2(1) and has one row that stores
value 'X' for the col.

The purpose of 'dual' is to practice functions
with the help of select statement.
