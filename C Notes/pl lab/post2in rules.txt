Expression Conversion from Postfix to Infix

1) U need a Operand stack
2) Read and process the entire postfix expression
3) detect incoming element is operator or operand
4) for operands, push in operand stack
5) for operators, pop out 2 operands
first val is opnd2
second val is opnd1
Result is 
   "(Opnd1opOpnd2)"
Push back the result into operand stack

6) after expression traversal is complete
stack contains a single val that is the
prefix of postfix. Pop it out and return it.
