                      Linked List

A linked list is a collection of sequentially
connected nodes.

Where a node is a custom datatype that can store 
1) data (information) 
2) address (memory location). 

(see diagram).

              Linked List and Array

In 2 ways a linked list resembles an array
1) homogenous type
2) sequential storage pattern

Hence algorithms that work on arrays
do work on linked lists as well and 
vice-versa.

Advantages of a linked list over an array

1) Uses dynamic memory management.
    (allocation and deallocation).
    It allows runtime expansion and reduction
    in size of the linked list.

   As compared array size is static prefixed.

2) Nodes can be added/removed from any
    location (beginning or intermediate or
    end).

   As compared array doesnt allow addition
   or removal of elements.

3) Memory (and hence life) of a linked list 
    is controlled by code.
  
   As compared memory of an array is 
   controlled by the system and is 
   determined scopewise.

Disadvantages of a linked list as compared
with an array.

As array elements are known by index so
a direct access of nth element is possible

Whereas to reach a nth node in a linked
list we need traversal of n-1 nodes. This
reduces efficiency.
