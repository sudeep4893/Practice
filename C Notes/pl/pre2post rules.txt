Expression Conversion from Prefix to Postfix

1) U need a Operand stack
2) Read and process the entire prefix expression
right to left
3) detect incoming element is operator or operand
4) for operands, push in operand stack
5) for operators, pop out 2 operands
first val is opnd1
second val is opnd2
Result is 
   "Opnd1Opnd2op"
Push back the result into operand stack

6) after expression traversal is complete
stack contains a single val that is the
postfix of perfix. 
Pop it out.
