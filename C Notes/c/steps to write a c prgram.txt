steps to write a C program

1) include header files

All functions of the header files get
imported into current program. Then
the functions can be readily used.

2) Define main() function 

OS starts program execution with main().
All the instructions inside main() will get
executed sequentially.
As code (instructions) of main() get over
program execution stops.

Hence said main() defines life of a C prg.


3) In main or in other functions declare variables, write instructions as per the 
task of the program.
