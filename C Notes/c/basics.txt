What is a computer?
A computer is a device that can execute programs.


What is a program?
A program is a set of instructions that
* take input
* process it
* generates output

A program is made up of
1) Code
Code means instructions.
Program instructions are grouped together
and a block of code is formed.
It is called as a function.

What is a function?
A function is a block of code.
It has a unique name, for its identification.
It is used to process program data.

Functions can be of 2 types.
1) Predefined Functions
Predefined functions are functions readily available 
for use.
These functions are grouped in a file called as "header file".
(A header file is a collection of predefined functions)

Users import the header file and directly call (execute)
the ready made functions defined in the header file.

2) User Defined Functions
These are defined by the user and then called (executed).

A program must have min. one user defined function, 
and it is the "main()".
----------------------------------------------------------------
2) Data
Data means information.
Data can be of two types.
  a) input
  b) output

Data (input or output) must be stored in variables.

What is a variable?
A variable is a block of memory.
It has a unique name, for its identification.
It is used to store program data(input/output).
It can hold only one value at a time.
Its value can change.

==================================

Q) Explain why code expansion takes place in C?
A) In a C program we have 2 types of functions
1) Predefined, that comes from header files we include.
2) User defined, that we make.

On compilation the system merges our code and the
code of the included header files, so that target code
that is generated has the size of both. i.e. is expanded.
