A stream is a channel of data transfer across
devices.
A stream can be 
1) Unidirectional
    Unidirectional streams allow one way data transfer.
    examples
    * Input stream
    * Output stream  
     
2) Bidirectional
    Bidirectional streams allow two way data transfer.
    example
    * Input and Output Stream


Streams are owned by the OS.
OS makes all streams available to the active
application.
When our C application will become active then
it will have access to all streams.
It is the job of code of C application to utilize the
available streams.

C provides ready made functions
like printf, scanf, ... through header files.
These functions have the ability to use
avialable streams.


printf is a ready made function.
It comes from header file stdio.h
printf fetches data from C prg and puts the 
data into std output stream (stdout) that
connects CPU and monitor. 

printf can output 3 types of data.
1) Data stored in variables.
2) Data enclosed in double quotes.
3) Cursor movement and special characters.
