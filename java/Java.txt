Java is a platform independent and
object oriented programming language.

Platform Independent
--------------------
Applications are developed in HLL.
The same are compiled and Binary
Executable Files are created.
The binary executable files are
compatible with a particular O/S.
Being compatible they also are 
dependent on the same particaular O/S.


Java Applications are developed in java.
The same are compiled and Binary
Executable Files are created. The binary 
executable files are compatible with JVM.
Being compatible they also are dependent 
on the JVM.

JVM's are available for all the O/S.
Hence a java binary executable file
can run on all the O/S.

Hence said that java applications are
platform independent.

ByteCode
---------
Bytecode is the binary executable file
generated by compilation of a Java
Program.

It is compiled to be compatible and
dependent on JVM.

On execution, it is Just In Time compiled
to become O/S compatible and executable.
(.java -> compile ->.class ->jvm -> o/s compatible form)

==========================================

Object Oriented Programming 
--------------------------
Applications developed using OOP languages
implement

Encapsulation : Is binding code and data
into one unit.

Polymorphism : Is implementation of
an operation in multiple ways.
