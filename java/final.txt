Java allows declaration of
* variables
* methods
* classes
as "final".

final class
----------
A final class is a class that cannot be inherited.
(see Fclass.java)

final method
------------
A final method is a method that cannot be overridden.
(see Fmethod.java)


final variables
-------------
(see Fvariable.java)

-- final local variable
  * Must be initialized once either along with declaration or anywhere before first use.
  * It can used ahead as a read only variable
  * It cannot be reassigned.

-- final formal parameter
  * Is initialized by the actual parameter per call to the method
  * It can used ahead as a read only variable
  * It cannot be reassigned.

-- final member variable
  * It can be initialized once per object, either alongwith declaration or by the initalizer block or by the constructor. Not by all. Never by any method.
  * It can used ahead as a read only variable
  * It cannot be reassigned.
