Packages
----------
A package is a collection of 
* classes
* interfaces
* nested packages

Purpose
--------
1) A package is used to define 
   * Java Projects/Applications
   * Java Libraries
2) It keeps related classes/interfaces together,
say in a compartment.
3) It even protects from name conflicts.

Creation
---------
To create a package simply create a 
directory of the same name as of the
package.

Adding classes and interfaces into a package
--------------------------------------- 
1) Define the classes and interfaces with
the package statement as their first statement.
2) Place them in the package directory.

Using a package
---------------
If the package represents an application
then generally it is converted into an 
"executable" jar file.

If the package represents a java library
then its "public" classes and interfaces 
can be "imported" and used by other classes
and interfaces, outside the package.

About import
--------------
"import" statement provides access of
public classes and interfaces of a package
to the current class or interface.

Example 
-------
import package.ClassName;
import package.*;


How does the system resolve "import" statements
------------------------------------------
To resolve an "import" statement system uses
1) Environment Variable : CLASSPATH
2) Compile time and Execution time Option : -classpath
------------------------------------
1) Setting the Environment Variable : CLASSPATH
Right click on my computer
Select Properties
Select Advanced
Select Environment Variables
Under System Variables
 Create/Edit : CLASSPATH
 Variable Name : CLASSPATH
 Variable Value : <existing>;.;locationOfPackage 
OK to all Windows
------------------------------------
2) Compile time and Execution time Option : -classpath

d:\java>javac -classpath "%classpath%";e: Learner.java
d:\java>java -classpath "%classpath%";e: Learner 

===================================
public class

A public class is a class that can be
imported and used outside the package.

It must be saved in a file that has the
same name as of the class.
