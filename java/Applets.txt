Applet
--------
An applet is a java program that is
embedded inside a webpage and is
executed by the web-browser.

How it works?
-------------
A web server hosts web pages with
applets embbeded in some of them.

Web client requests the web server
for a web page that contains an applet.
In response the web server transmits
the web page and the embedded applet.

The web browser receives both and
* parses and renders the web page
* loads the applet in memory.
* executes the applet life cycle methods.

Life Cycle Methods and Their Execution
-----------------------------------
Applet has 4 life cycle methods
1) public void init()
2) public void start()
3) public void stop()
4) public void destroy()

init()
------
init() is the applets life cycle method
that executes first and only once.
It is used for all initializations, like a
constructor.

start()
-------
start() is the applets life cycle method
that executes 
* once after init().
* once as the page is revisited.
It is used for on visit activity.

stop()
------
stop() is the applets life cycle method
that executes 
* once before destroy().
* once as the page is left.

It is used for on leave activity.

destroy()
---------
destroy() is the applets life cycle method
that executes last and only once when 
the web browser decides to unload the
applet from memory.

It is used for resource clean up.


How to code?
-------------
To make an applet define a public class 
that extends java.applet.Applet

As per the need override the applet's
life cycle methods.

Also define (override) a paint() method 
for all applet rendering.
