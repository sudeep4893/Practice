GUI based applications
---------------------------
A GUI based application 

1) Presents a graphical user interface to the 
user. Generally a window with components in it. 
2) Code of the application is associated with
GUI components.
3) As user of the application interacts with the
GUI components, events occur.
4) Code of the application is associated with
events. And hence gets executed on events.


Event Driven Programming
-------------------------------
Is an approach to code execution on event occurrence.


Steps to implement Event Driven Programming
----------------------------------------------------
1) Define a container (window/frame/panel/applet/...)
2) Define GUI components
3) Add and position the GUI components in the container
GUI components can be positioned in 2 ways
  a) Automatically through layout managers //default
  b) Manually by setting x, y, w, h of every component through setBounds(x, y, w, h) method
4) Apply event listeners to the required GUI components
5) Associate code with event procedures, so that it gets
executed on event.
